# Project Instructions
Follow the instructions here: https://vuxcode.netlify.app/new/pr1/lessons/major-project-brief/

REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT! 

The final program is not the goal! The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your program, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

# Project Notes

# Project Summary

> Firstly, I think I spent too much time on the CSS for this program and I think it slowed down the development of the javascript portion, but I think the design/theme for the program/website was pretty spot on so im not too bothered about it. Only thing that I thought was lacking was the index page, mainly because of there is really nothing on it other than links to the program and about pages, and I really struggled with figuring out what to do with it (I still am). 

> The problem I had the most with this project was because the code itself was so long, I found it annoying/difficult to find the specific sections of the code I wanted to change or
fix if there was any problems with the code. I didn't really fix it but I made it easier for me by making a seperate file for the CSS and the different pages for the website. I could actually fix this issue by simply having a seperate file for each section (skeleton fight for example) of the code, but not sure how that would work although I could learn how to make that happen.

> Another thing that was annoying was using alerts in general, even if they are useful they are not ideal to work with in my opinion (they are also quite ugly to look at), for example
if you press Enter really fast you could just go through the entire program and almost break it.

> Using buttons was quite useful and fun but I had some issues with "hiding" the buttons early on in the development, mostly because of the amount of buttons I used (a lot) and the naming of their id's was inefficient (output 1/2 etc). However as soon as I changed their id's into more efficient names, I didn't really have more problems with hiding buttons.

> The if statements was probably one of the more challenging parts of the program, considering how complicated some of them are. For example when you press on one of the door buttons the button uses an if statement with 3 else-if and 1 else conditionals, they also have a couple of if statements within themselves(and mutliple alerts, outputs etc), needless to say getting everything to work within that chain of conditionals was a huge task but I think it worked out great in the end.

> Lastly, getting the skeleton fight section of the code to work was also something I worked a lot on, as I wanted it to use a sort of turn-based system or atleast mimic a system like that. It was really basic at first, not even being a while-loop at first and just making use of if statements and the -= operator. The issue was because I was using a slight delay for the attack of the skeletons, the alerts would still happen after you would defeat them and that is not at all how I wanted it to work + it's terrible user experience. So I decided that I needed to use a while-loop in order to make sure that the loop breaks the alert after you defeat the skeletons.
